# MDN for Nuclear Masses

Machine learning application to nuclear physics. A mixture density network [(MDN)](https://github.com/tonyduan/mixture-density-network) and random forest algorithms are applied to fit nuclear masses and predict those of nuclei yet to be sinthesized experimentally. The data comes from the [AME(2020)](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/ame2020/mass_1.mas20.txt) and [FRDM(2012)](https://t2.lanl.gov/nis/molleretal/publications/ADNDT-FRDM2012.html)

The main files to look at the results are the presentation "Statistical_learning.pdf" and notebook "Projectv5.ipynb".
